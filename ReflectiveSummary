Film Jamz is predicitive analytics model where potentail fil investors, producers, directors, etc. 
can input different types of film informationa and the model will predict how well the movie will 
do with audiences. We used a chosen algorithm, 5 different plots to show our data, and we presented 
it in front of our peers.
For our desired algorithm, random forest regression, we preprocessed our data which contains 6820 
records. We used 10 predictor variables to decide what is the best feature when predicting how well 
a movie will do. The variables are company, country, director, genre, gross revenue, name, rating, 
runtime, score and votes. After completing the preprocessing, we applied random forest regression
algorithm, which is one of the most effective machine learning models for predictive analytics. 
The random forest regression algorithm is a classification algorithm. What it does is create a 
forest with several trees. The more trees, the more robust it will be. In the same way in the random 
forest classifier, the higher the number of trees, the higher the accuracy results. Once we ran the 
algorithm, it was revealed that rating was the best feature when deciding how well a movie will perform. 
We then proceeded to graph our data where it showed rating as having a remarkable weight advantage versus 
its counterparts.
